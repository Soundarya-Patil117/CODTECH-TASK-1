OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT
Project : Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) on World Population Dataset.

The dataset contains demographic information about various countries over several decades, specifically focusing on population statistics. Here’s a simplified breakdown of its key components:

STRUCTURE OF THE DATASET:

Columns: The dataset includes the following columns:
Rank: The ranking of the country based on its population size.
Country: The name of the country.
Country Code: A three-letter code representing the country (e.g., CHN for China).
Population Figures: Population data for the years 1980, 2000, 2010, 2021, 2022, 2030, and projected for 2050.
Area: Total area of the country.
Land Area (km²): The land area in square kilometers.
Growth Rate: The rate of population growth over time.
World Percentage: The percentage of the world population that each country represents.
Density: Population density, calculated as the number of people per square kilometer of land.

KEY INSIGHTS:

Population Trends: The dataset shows how the populations of different countries have changed over the years, highlighting significant growth in countries like China and India.
Future Projections: It includes projections for future populations up to 2050, allowing for analysis of expected demographic changes.
Geographic and Demographic Analysis: By comparing the area and population density, one can assess how densely populated a country is relative to its size.

This dataset is useful for researchers, policymakers, and educators to understand demographic trends and make informed decisions based on population growth and density patterns across the globe.
